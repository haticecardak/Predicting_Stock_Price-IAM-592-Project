I would like to study stock price estimation on the financial market. Firstly, I researched the method that is used to estimate stock price, I found the Reinforcement Learning (RL) method being an area of Machine Learning. This method is mainly talk about the interaction between environment and the result. The idea behind the RL interacting with the environment many times and getting the reward or penalty with respect to action result, then it will find the optimal way and result by gaining experience. In this method has so many submethod but i want to work Q-table (Quality-table)
